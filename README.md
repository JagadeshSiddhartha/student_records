# student_records
A small PHP web application to store student details.
The testdata.php file is used to create test data.
The webapp allows you to insert, update and delete student records.
student_details.sql is the database file used to store records.
Included bootstrap and Models for a clean interface
and made it a single page webapp. I have included scroll bar and styling for a better interface.
Feel free to make changes.
